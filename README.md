# Duck, Duck, Tree!
A simple game to encourage planting trees. This is my first Phaser project!
## How to Play
Clone the repo
```git clone https://github.com/ebehop/Duck-Duck-Tree.git && cd Duck-Duck-Tree```
Run on a local development server like xampp
Hit SPACE to start
The duck follows your cursor when it is moving while you can hit space to plant trees.
